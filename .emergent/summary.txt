The previous AI engineer successfully transformed an e-commerce application. Initially, the engineer corrected the understanding of the tech stack (from React/FastAPI/MongoDB to Next.js/Node.js/SQLite). Key tasks included replacing placeholder product images with real ones, migrating from 22+ to 8 products, and fixing multiple image loading and database (SQLite vs. MongoDB confusion, CORS) issues. Subsequently, a critical communication feature was added, enabling buyers and sellers to interact, with strict access rules for administrators. Finally, seller information was integrated into product detail pages, and a new task on category verification was just initiated, focusing on understanding the existing AI-powered verification functions. The work demonstrates robust debugging and feature implementation.

<product_requirements>
The user tasked the AI engineer with enhancing an existing e-commerce application. The core problem was to improve the visual authenticity and reduce the number of products displayed.
Initially, the explicit requests were:
1.  **Replace current products**: Delete the existing list of products.
2.  **Use real images**: Implement product listings with actual images, similar to the shop by category section.
3.  **Reduce product count**: Limit the total number of products to 8.
4.  **Category distribution**: Two products per category (Fruits, Vegetables, Seeds, Spices).
5.  **User-provided images**: Utilize specific images provided by the user for the 8 products (Apple, Orange, Carrot, Spinach, Sunflower seeds, Chia seeds, Cinnamon, Turmeric), ensuring good descriptions.

Later requests extended the scope:
6.  **Seller-Buyer Communication**: Add a communication link to the seller dashboard, allowing sellers to talk to other users.
7.  **Communication Access Control**: Ensure only sellers and buyers can communicate with each other, and they cannot contact admins unless the admin initiates the contact.
8.  **Display Seller Info on Product Page**: Show the seller's username and other relevant details on the product detail page, making it easier for buyers to know whom to contact for product-related inquiries.
9.  **Product Deletion**: Delete all products from the database (after a user query about mangoes).

The product is an e-commerce platform with a Next.js frontend and Node.js backend using SQLite. The application displays products, allows category browsing, features a shopping cart, and includes user authentication for buyers, sellers, and admins.

-   ****: Main server setup file.
    -   **Summary**: Initializes the Express app, configures CORS, and registers all API routes.

-   ****: Handles product-related API endpoints.
    -   **Summary**: Defines routes for fetching, adding, updating products. Includes an image serving endpoint.
    -   **Changes**: Modified the  route to include  (User) information via a Sequelize join when fetching individual product details. This was crucial for displaying Sold by information.
-   ****: Handles category-related API endpoints.
    -   **Summary**: Manages product categories and possibly category-based filtering.
    -   **Changes**: The trajectory indicates it contains AI-powered category verification features, which the AI engineer began exploring at the very end. No explicit modifications were made to this file yet.
-   ****: Manages user-to-user communication.
    -   **Summary**: Handles creating conversations, sending messages, and searching for users.
    -   **Changes**: Modified user search functionality () to filter out 'Admin' and 'SuperAdmin' users when a buyer or seller is searching, ensuring they can only communicate if an admin initiates contact.
-   ****: The SQLite database file.
    -   **Summary**: Stores all application data, including products, users, categories, etc.
    -   **Changes**: Directly updated by scripts (, , ) to manage product data. Initially, there was a misdiagnosis attempting to use MongoDB, which was corrected to use SQLite.
-   ****: Backend environment variables.
    -   **Summary**: Contains crucial environment variables like , , , , .
    -   **Changes**: Fixed parsing issue by removing spaces around the  sign for  and , critical for CORS to function correctly.  was also configured (though a persistent SQLite issue indicated it might not have been fully effective for database selection).
-   ****: Displays products categorized.
    -   **Summary**: Renders product listings on category pages.
    -   **Changes**: Updated image rendering from  to direct URL usage () because the backend now serves raw image bytes, not base64.
-   ****: Displays individual product details.
    -   **Summary**: Shows detailed information about a single product.
    -   **Changes**: Similar to , image rendering was updated to use direct URLs. Crucially, the component was modified to properly handle   values returned from  to fix serialization errors. Also, a new Sold by section was added to display seller username, name, and role, along with a conditional Contact Seller button.

<current_work>
The most recent work focused on enhancing the product detail page for buyers. The AI engineer successfully implemented the display of seller information on the product page. This involved modifying the backend API endpoint () to include seller details (UserID, Username, FirstName, LastName, UserAuth) by performing a Sequelize join with the  table.

On the frontend, the  component was updated to render a new Sold by section. This section visually presents the seller's username (e.g., ), full name (e.g., ), and their role (). A Contact Seller button was also added, which is conditionally displayed only if a user is logged in. Clicking this button is designed to seamlessly navigate to the communications page, pre-filling the target username and a subject relevant to the product.

To test this, a temporary Test Mango product was created with an associated seller () after all previous products were deleted. The API response was verified to include the new seller data, and a screenshot confirmed the frontend display.

Immediately following the completion of the seller information feature, the user initiated a new task: I have a question regarding the verification of the category of a product. First of all, how does it work? How am I supposed to present it. The AI engineer has just started investigating this, specifically looking into  and noting existing AI-powered category verification features. The engineer is in the initial exploration phase for this new feature.
